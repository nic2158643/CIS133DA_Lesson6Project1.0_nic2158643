    <p style="font-size:24px;color:black">An easy way to describe Social Media, is basically a tool for people from around the world to post and comment on different activities, events, or occurrence's that they want others to know about.<br>
    In other words, its mostly for entertainment purposes, I mean people today, mostly use these tech pieces for whatever reasons, but I guess all of us are different.</p>

        <p style="font-size:20px;color:black">In today's society, technology has advanced completely to a whole new generation and people are still adapting to each and everyone of them. We as the people of this planet have a serious piece of technology today called the "smart phone," this simple item can do a lot more then just make simple phone calls.
        Most of the older people in this current 2023 society are actually not too moderate to understand the different parts of these devices being created, so they have to speak to their younger generation for tutorials.
        Honestly, most of the phones today have these digital components called "apps," each and everyone of these apps have different meanings and work differently. However, even though technologist have created so many of these apps, there is still the most commonly used apps for which almost everyone uses and that's called, "communication or social media."
        Social media has become the most moderate means of communications for many years now, I mean you can use all kinds of apps to communicate with and I personally find it somewhat stupid. Like I can message someone using Snapchat, TikTok, Messenger, or just my regular message app that came with my phone using my number. 
        Most of the people today, in my opinion, would rather use third-party apps, because they feel as though their identities would be easily taken. There's no point though, because if you use social media apps, hackers and cyber attackers actually have more of an advantage and that's the sad part.</p>
